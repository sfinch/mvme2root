Currently only works for one MDPP-16 module with SCP/RCP firmware.

SYNOPSIS
    ./mvme2root [-v] filename.mvmelst

DESCRIPTION
    Converts filename.mvmelst to filename.root. All instances of "mvmelst" are replaced with
    "root" in the filename and path. The structure of the root file is dictated by the
    object rootTree. Works with either .mvmelst files or .zip files. When using .zip
    files, the .mvmelst file inside the zip file must have the same filename as the .zip
    file (i.e. you cannot rename the zip files).

OPTIONS
    -v      Verbose mode. Prints out every value. Useful for debugging.
