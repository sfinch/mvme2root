Currently only works for one MDPP-16 module with SCP/RCP firmware.

SYNOPSIS
    ./mvme2root [-v] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
    Converts filename.mvmelst or filename.zip to filename.root. If multiple files are
    given, does this for files, but will promptly abort batch execution if an error is
    encountered with a file. All instances of "mvmelst" are replaced with "root" in the
    filename and path. 
    
    Works with either .mvmelst files or .zip files. Unzipping is done
    using the command "zip -o" on your system. When using .zip files, the .mvmelst file
    inside the a zip file must have the same filename as the .zip file (i.e. you cannot
    rename the zip files). 
    
    The energy calibration is extracted from the file analysis.analysis, and the
    time is extracted from messages.log. These files are included in the .zip file. If you
    are using a .mvmelst file, these values may be incorrect. 

    The structure of the root file and tree is dictated by the object rootTree. 

OPTIONS
    -v      Verbose mode. Prints out every value. Useful for debugging.
